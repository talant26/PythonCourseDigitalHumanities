I originally designed this course for the [CSBMR](https://csmbr.fondazionecomel.org/) STUDIOLO Winter School 2024. Its aim is to introduce humanities scholars with no prior knowledge to the basics of Python and demonstrate typical applications in the humanities, such as extracting and visualising information from texts. By the end of 2025, I had adapted the course materials to enable self-study.

# How to use the materials
The repository contains the file *Reader.pdf*. This split into two parts. The first part introduces the fundamentals of Python, while the second part provides a list of essential tools for working with texts in the field of digital humanities. It also provides references and links to further materials and websites for self-study.

While the reader can be worked through independently, it is ideally used alongside the *BasicPython.ipynb* and *PracticalProject.ipynb* files. *BasicPython* contains sample scripts and exercises to accompany and supplement the reader. *PracticalProject* uses H. P. Lovecraft's novel *At the Mountains of Madness* as an example to demonstrate how to extract and visualise information from texts.

# Google Colab
I recommend uploading the .ipynb files to Google Colab and editing them there. You will need a Google account to do this. You will also need to upload the .txt files for *PracticalProject.ipynb* there.

**Recommendations for working with Google Colab:**
* Tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/index.htm
* Change the editor so that line numbers are displayed. (Tools -> Settings -> Editor -> show line numbers)
* Google Colab does not permanently store files. To keep your files, download them or save them to Google Drive.
* If errors occur when executing individual scripts, please click the 'Run all' button, which can be found either at the top of the menu bar or in the 'Runtime' > 'Run all' tab. This will execute all scripts in the correct order. This helps to avoid errors that may occur if the session has been inactive for too long, for example, or if a script accesses variables that have not been set previously.
* If an error persists, you can try to restart a session (Runtime > Restart Session).
* For the scripts in *PracticalProject.ipynb* to work, make sure you have uploaded the files 'Copyright.txt', 'Mainpart.txt' and 'DoubleNames.csv'.

The text of the novel 'Mountains of Madness' comes from the Gutenberg Project ( https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70652 ). The text has been split into two parts 'Copyright.txt' and 'Mainpart.txt'. Please note the copyright!
